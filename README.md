# a_star-path-finding-algorithm

This project is a visualization for the A* path finding algorithm. It finds the shortest path between two nodes on a grid, without impeding any barriers. This algorithm utilizes a Priority Queue and Pygame within Python.

In the grid, different colors represent different things.
  Green - start
  Red - end 
  Light Blue - nodes examined
  Dark Blue - nodes to be examined
  Yellow - shortest path
